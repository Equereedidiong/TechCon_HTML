I must sway the non-believers.

If they follow me, we can
disrupt spice production.

That's the only way I
can get to the Emperor.

[Stilgar] Thirty-eight
million decaliters.

216
00:19:45,503 --> 00:19:51,307
None of us, even dying of
thirst, would ever drink this water.

217

This is...

218

sacred.

219
00:19:59,077 --> 00:20:00,378
Jamis' water.

220

We have a thousand such places.

When we have enough water,

00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:13,756
the <i>Lisan al-Gaib</i> will
change the face of Arrakis.

Never give your water away,
not even for the dead. Hmm?

230
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:43,054
Why are you showing me this?

231
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,794
Because you are Bene Gesserit.

232
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:48,563
Because you understand
the prophecies.

233
00:20:48,698 --> 00:20:52,397
The mother of the <i>Lisan al-Gaib</i>
will be a Reverend Mother.

234
00:20:53,464 --> 00:20:56,203
Our Reverend Mother is dying.

[whispers] You want
me to take her place?

236

Yes, I do.

You believe in Paul?

There are signs.

What if I would refuse?

242
00:21:17,523 --> 00:21:20,324
Mmm. Then, he's
not <i>Lisan al-Gaib,</i>

243
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:22,399
and you have no
purpose to serve.

244
00:21:22,534 --> 00:21:26,601
What else is left to do then but
to return your water to the well?

245
00:21:26,737 --> 00:21:28,301

[Paul] It's an honor, isn't it?

248
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:36,177
I think you should feel honored.

249
00:21:36,313 --> 00:21:38,212
Well, it was a choice
between this or death,

250
00:21:38,347 --> 00:21:40,379
so, you know, forgive
me if I'm not flattered.

251
00:21:42,351 --> 00:21:43,954
How does one become
a Reverend Mother?

252
00:21:44,089 --> 00:21:45,953
It's different from
one culture to another.

253
00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:48,189
Here on Arrakis, I have no idea.

254
00:21:52,531 --> 00:21:54,395
You're afraid.

255
00:21:54,531 --> 00:21:56,385
Reverend Mothers are tasked
with holding the memories

256
00:21:56,465 --> 00:21:58,255
of all the Reverend Mothers
that came before them,

257
00:21:58,335 --> 00:22:01,697
so I'll be given centuries
of pain and sorrow.

258
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,540
Is it dangerous?

259
00:22:04,203 --> 00:22:06,042
It's lethal for men.

260
00:22:06,676 --> 00:22:08,171
That's for sure.

[Chani] No, we don't.

Southern beliefs?

275

Southern tribes believe a messiah
will come to deliver us from evil.

You don't believe
in the <i>Lisan al-Gaib?</i>

- [Chani] Stilgar?
- Mm-hmm.

Blasphemy.

1793
00:27:18,574 --> 00:27:20,117
The prophecy has been accomplished.

1794

She's right. She's right!

You're so close now.

Only one step remains and you
will become the <i>Kwisatz Haderach.</i>

Only one step remains.

350
00:29:13,632 --> 00:29:14,963
You must do what I did.

351
00:29:15,099 --> 00:29:18,302
You must drink
the Water of Life.

352
00:29:18,438 --> 00:29:22,511
And your mind, it's gon... it's
gonna open and you will see.

[speaking Chakobsa]

1801
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:26,327
You will see!

1802
00:29:26,619 --> 00:29:29,664
The beauty and the horror!

354
00:29:33,157 --> 00:29:38,093
[Stilgar] If you wanna fight
with us, first thing, you must learn

355
00:29:38,229 --> 00:29:40,155
to be one with the desert.

356
00:29:41,597 --> 00:29:44,864
So, here is a tent
and enough food.

357
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,934
I want you to cross that

Uh, beside the worms
and the Harkonnens,

364
00:30:01,946 --> 00:30:05,587
beware of the trapdoor spiders.

365
00:30:05,723 --> 00:30:09,189
Centipedes are very
nasty. Not the big ones.

366
00:30:09,324 --> 00:30:10,892
They are harmless.

367
00:30:11,027 --> 00:30:14,860
But the little ones, you have
to worry about. And... Oh!

368
00:30:17,161 --> 00:30:20,998
Don't ever, ever
listen to the jinn.

369
00:30:23,274 --> 00:30:24,841
- The jinn?
- Jinn.

370

the ways of the desert."

You care for him now?

1811

He's not like the other strangers.

1812

He's sincere.

Yeah, I'm doing
pretty good so far.

Yeah, well, you're not
even in worm territory yet.

388
00:32:44,782 --> 00:32:46,682
[Chani] You have to
break up your rhythm.

389
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:52,517
Like this.

390
00:32:52,653 --> 00:32:55,422
[Paul] Now, that's interesting
because in the filmbooks I've studied,

391
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:59,222
the anthropologists say, in order to
properly sandwalk, you actually have...

392
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:05,162
Never mind. Please keep going.

You know, I'm the only one who believes
you're gonna make it until summer?

Everyone else thinks you
won't make it two weeks.

396
00:33:40,001 --> 00:33:41,252
If you wanna follow
us in the desert,

397
00:33:41,332 --> 00:33:42,831
you need to know
how windtraps work.

398
00:33:42,966 --> 00:33:44,500
So, listen to me.

399
00:33:44,636 --> 00:33:46,973
They're simple, but they
require constant attention.

Uh, this right here, it
captures the moisture

401
00:33:50,408 --> 00:33:52,242
and then it carries
it into that pocket.

402

Uh, and these are the filters.

403
00:33:56,249 --> 00:33:58,116

Mm-hmm.

You're right. If we want
to protect your brother,

411
00:34:23,178 --> 00:34:26,382

You saw what he did.

1814
00:40:21,816 --> 00:40:25,695
He saw it coming,
and he saved her life.

1815
00:40:26,529 --> 00:40:28,197
He saw it.

1816
00:40:28,948 --> 00:40:30,116
He can foresee.

466
00:40:40,387 --> 00:40:42,119
Who taught you
to fight like that?

467
00:40:42,255 --> 00:40:43,922
- My old masters.
- Hmm.

468
00:40:44,058 --> 00:40:45,523
They were close friends.

469
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:51,760
They were massacred.
Alongside my father.

470
00:40:56,934 --> 00:41:00,208
You've been fighting the
Harkonnens for decades.

471
00:41:00,344 --> 00:41:02,611
My family's been
fighting them for centuries.

472
00:41:02,747 --> 00:41:07,610
I know everything about them.
Their habits, their ways of thinking.

473
00:41:07,746 --> 00:41:09,172
You know everything
about the desert.

474
00:41:09,252 --> 00:41:12,413
You harness the
very power of it.

475
00:41:12,548 --> 00:41:17,588
We can stop them together, bury
them in the sand where they belong.

476
00:41:17,723 --> 00:41:19,887
So that this planet can
be yours once more.

477
00:41:20,023 --> 00:41:23,898
[deeply inhales] What
would you have us do? Huh?

478
00:41:24,033 --> 00:41:25,666
What would you do, Stilgar?

479
00:41:25,801 --> 00:41:29,937
I? I would... [sighs] would
strike even further north.

480
00:41:30,073 --> 00:41:31,671
Then I will go further north.

481
00:41:31,807 --> 00:41:34,742
And the further north you
go, the more likely it is you die.

482
00:41:34,878 --> 00:41:36,508
[speaking Chakobsa]

1818
00:41:35,932 --> 00:41:37,350
Then I'll die.

1819
00:41:37,767 --> 00:41:39,018
Maybe you will too.

1820
00:41:40,394 --> 00:41:43,022
But the others will keep going.

1821
00:41:44,148 --> 00:41:46,984
And they won't stop
until the Fremen are free.

483
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,157
[Fedaykin fighters chattering]

1822
00:41:51,197 --> 00:41:52,907
He deserves to be Fedaykin.

485
00:41:53,391 --> 00:41:55,395
[speaking Chakobsa]

1823
00:41:54,534 --> 00:41:56,452
He needs names, Stilgar.

1824
00:41:56,827 --> 00:41:57,870
He does!

486
00:41:58,532 --> 00:42:01,736
[Stilgar] I see strength in you.

487
00:42:01,872 --> 00:42:02,934

488
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,140
[all agreeing]

1825
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:04,627
Like Usul.

1826
00:42:04,961 --> 00:42:07,296
The base of the pillar.

489
00:42:07,271 --> 00:42:08,610
Come, come.

[man laughing]

491
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:24,222
You shall be know
among us as <i>Usul.</i>

492
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:25,823
- [man] <i>Usul.
- Usul.</i>

493
00:42:25,958 --> 00:42:30,095
[Stilgar] <i>Usul.</i> And now,
a Fedaykin is a fighter

494
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,629
and needs a war name.

495
00:42:32,395 --> 00:42:33,895
You must choose.

496
00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:40,242
How do you call the, uh...

497
00:42:41,474 --> 00:42:43,106
The small desert mouse, again?

- [Paul] <i>Muad'Dib.</i>

No, no, no. [shushes]

501
00:42:48,849 --> 00:42:52,820
<i>Muad'Dib</i> is wise in
the ways of the desert.

502
00:42:52,955 --> 00:42:54,355
<i>Muad'Dib...</i>

503
00:42:55,191 --> 00:42:57,320
[sighs] creates his own water.

504
00:42:57,456 --> 00:43:01,424
The constellation that points to
the North Star, we call <i>Muad'Dib.</i>

505
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,562
"The One Who Points the Way."

506
00:43:05,232 --> 00:43:06,664
That is a powerful name.

507
00:43:11,405 --> 00:43:15,371
Now you are our brother. Mmm.

508
00:43:15,506 --> 00:43:18,841

Chakobsa, laughs]

522
00:44:36,126 --> 00:44:37,293
[Paul] It's breathtaking.

[sighs]

524
00:44:46,034 --> 00:44:47,303
[Chani] Hmm.

525
00:44:48,666 --> 00:44:52,671
Look. Right there. Spice.

526
00:44:52,806 --> 00:44:55,839
Arrakis is so beautiful
when the sun is low.

527
00:45:03,116 --> 00:45:07,921
Where you're from, does
water really fall from the sky?

528
00:45:08,056 --> 00:45:09,853
Oh, hm, yes.

529
00:45:09,988 --> 00:45:13,261
Sometimes it rains
for weeks on Caladan.

530
00:45:13,397 --> 00:45:15,859
Where you see sand
here, imagine water.

531
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:22,833
Our castle stands on
cliffs high above the sea.

532
00:45:22,968 --> 00:45:25,804
If you dive in, you
can't reach the bottom.

533
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:29,808
- [Chani] You dive in?
- Yes, it's called swimming.

534
00:45:29,943 --> 00:45:32,847
[laughs] I don't... I
don't believe you, <i>Usul.</i>

<i>- Sihaya.</i>
- Hmm.

539
00:45:44,721 --> 00:45:46,356
What does that mean?

540
00:45:46,492 --> 00:45:48,225
Means Desert Spring.

541
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,629
"Desert Spring."

542
00:45:51,367 --> 00:45:53,028
- I love it.
- I hate it.

543
00:45:53,996 --> 00:45:56,064
It's from some stupid prophecy.

544
00:45:57,105 --> 00:45:58,132
I prefer Chani.

545
00:45:59,209 --> 00:46:00,739
I prefer Chani, too, then.

546
00:46:07,649 --> 00:46:09,482
Do you think Stilgar
would teach me?

547
00:46:09,618 --> 00:46:11,012
- [Chani] To ride?
- [Paul] Yeah.

548
00:46:11,148 --> 00:46:14,488
[Chani laughs] No.
Only Fremen ride worms.

549
00:46:14,624 --> 00:46:16,288
Well, I thought I'd
become one, didn't I?

550
00:46:16,423 --> 00:46:18,493
By name, not by blood.

551
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:25,533
Your blood comes from
Dukes and Great Houses.

552
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:29,569
We don't have that here.

553
00:46:29,705 --> 00:46:33,607
Here, we're equal,
men and women alike.

554
00:46:33,742 --> 00:46:35,807
What we do, we do
for the benefit of all.

555
00:46:35,942 --> 00:46:38,513
Well, I'd very much
like to be equal to you.

Paul <i>Muad'Dib Usul...</i>

557
00:46:49,688 --> 00:46:52,054
maybe you could be Fremen.

558
00:46:55,265 --> 00:46:56,663
Maybe I'll show you the way.

[Baron Harkonnen] Fremen
attacks on your watch.

568
00:48:41,897 --> 00:48:47,971
Your orders were to restore
spice production to full capacity.

569
00:48:48,107 --> 00:48:50,744
Do you know what
it means if you fail?

570
00:48:52,145 --> 00:48:56,244
The Emperor will take
spice out of our control.

571
00:48:57,079 --> 00:48:58,585
Tighten your grip, Rabban.

572
00:48:58,721 --> 00:49:00,655
[breathes heavily,
whispers] Uncle.

573
00:49:00,791 --> 00:49:03,284

feel mine on your neck.

Hey.

I'm here, I'm here.

579
00:49:34,024 --> 00:49:37,188
It's been a while since you've
had one of those nightmares.

580
00:49:37,324 --> 00:49:38,324
Mm.

581
00:49:41,961 --> 00:49:44,292
[Chani] Tell me,
what was it about?

582
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:50,034

583

<i>I'm in the South, and
I'm following someone.</i>

<i>And it triggers a holy war.</i>

587
00:50:06,221 --> 00:50:10,120
<i>Millions and millions of
people starving to death...</i>

588
00:50:11,459 --> 00:50:12,826
<i>because of me.</i>

589
00:50:18,332 --> 00:50:21,567
[Chani] You've been exposed
to spice for a long time.

590
00:50:21,702 --> 00:50:23,666
It can create weird dreams.

591
00:50:23,801 --> 00:50:25,641
[breathes heavily]

592
00:50:30,807 --> 00:50:31,878
It's a big day.

593
00:50:33,848 --> 00:50:35,380
We can ask
Stilgar to call it off.

594
00:50:35,516 --> 00:50:38,181
No. I'm fine.

595
00:50:40,357 --> 00:50:41,987

- Here.
- [Paul] Thanks.

[sighs]

600
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:09,949
Don't try to impress anyone.
You are brave. We all know that.

601
00:51:10,715 --> 00:51:12,980
Heh? Be simple.

602
00:51:13,116 --> 00:51:16,217
Be direct. Nothing fancy.

603
00:51:16,352 --> 00:51:18,386
- Nothing fancy.
- Hey, I'm serious.

604
00:51:18,521 --> 00:51:21,090
Nothing fancy or you
will shame my teaching.

I won't shame you. I understand.

You know I can't.

691
01:00:55,399 --> 01:00:56,732
She's asking why.

692
01:00:56,868 --> 01:00:58,735
Because I must continue
fighting in the North,

693
01:00:58,870 --> 01:01:01,276
to protect you down
there in the South.

694
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:06,175
She says she can
tell when you lie.

695
01:01:06,311 --> 01:01:10,010
Tell her that's because our mother
keeps spreading dangerous tales.

[thumping continues]

697
01:01:17,422 --> 01:01:19,126
What is she saying now?

698
01:01:19,262 --> 01:01:21,561
She says you're blinded by love,

699
01:01:21,696 --> 01:01:23,758
and she reminds you that
you must reserve your hand

700
01:01:23,894 --> 01:01:25,927
for the most strategic alliance.

701
01:01:28,563 --> 01:01:31,838
She's also wondering why
you don't believe in who you are.

702
01:01:31,974 --> 01:01:32,866
I do believe.

703
01:01:33,001 --> 01:01:35,310
I believe I matter
to these people.

704

And I believe I'm making
a difference in this war.

- That's not what she means.
- I know what she means.

707
01:01:45,216 --> 01:01:47,855
Do you not think I also feel
the weight of the prophecy?

708
01:01:47,991 --> 01:01:49,653
It's not a prophecy.

709
01:01:49,788 --> 01:01:51,391
It's a story that
you keep telling,

710
01:01:51,527 --> 01:01:53,460
but it's not their
story, it's yours.

711
01:01:53,595 --> 01:01:56,695
They deserve to be
led by one of their own.

712
01:01:56,830 --> 01:01:59,431
What your people did to
this world is heartbreaking.

713

something to hope for.

None of this magnitude.

773
01:08:55,143 --> 01:08:56,949
So, my dear daughter...

774
01:08:58,018 --> 01:09:00,414
how would you deal
with this prophet?

775
01:09:01,753 --> 01:09:03,516
[breathes heavily]

776
01:09:06,423 --> 01:09:09,489
If this <i>Muad'Dib</i>
is a religious figure,

777
01:09:11,028 --> 01:09:12,998
you can't use direct force.

778
01:09:14,299 --> 01:09:17,431
Repression only
makes a religion flourish.

779
01:09:17,566 --> 01:09:19,738
You'll only end up
humiliating yourself.

780
01:09:19,873 --> 01:09:21,302
You underestimate my Sardaukar.

781
01:09:21,438 --> 01:09:24,504
You underestimate
the power of faith.

782
01:09:26,282 --> 01:09:27,874
[chuckles]

783
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:31,984
Her Highness proves once again
that she was my most acute student.

784
01:09:34,056 --> 01:09:36,822
- You'd send assassins?
- [Princess Irulan] No.

785
01:09:36,958 --> 01:09:38,925
Prophets get
stronger when they die.

786
01:09:40,391 --> 01:09:42,894
Let the conflict on
Arrakis turn into war.

787
01:09:43,030 --> 01:09:46,394
You then bring
peace. As a savior.

788
01:09:48,737 --> 01:09:50,871
You'd be a formidable empress.

789
01:09:52,970 --> 01:09:54,870
[tense music playing]

790
01:09:55,006 --> 01:09:57,841
<i>Muad'Dib.</i> The prophet.

791
01:09:57,976 --> 01:10:00,345
The one who points the way.

792
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,745
These are our own
religious patterns, aren't they?

793
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,346
This is our doing.

794
01:10:07,822 --> 01:10:10,757
<i>Muad'Dib</i> means kangaroo mouse.

795
01:10:10,893 --> 01:10:12,992
An unusual war
name for a Fremen.

796
01:10:14,793 --> 01:10:17,793
- What if Paul Atreides were still alive?
- [distorted] Enough!

797
01:10:17,928 --> 01:10:22,463
This must not come out. Even
to your father's ears. Understand?

798
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:25,834
I do, Reverend Mother.

799
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:29,303
[Reverend Mother Mohiam] If Paul
is alive, he likely knows the truth.

800
01:10:29,439 --> 01:10:31,311
And should the
Great Houses learn

801
01:10:31,446 --> 01:10:34,443
that your father was behind
the liquidation of the Atreides,

802
01:10:34,578 --> 01:10:38,314
your father will face
war and lose the throne.

803
01:10:40,083 --> 01:10:41,614
Then what hope is there?

804
01:10:42,951 --> 01:10:44,023
Hope?

805
01:10:45,291 --> 01:10:49,622
We are Bene Gesserit.
We don't hope, we plan.

806
01:10:50,799 --> 01:10:54,260
Paul is not our only prospect.

807
01:10:54,395 --> 01:11:00,006
The Baron's youngest nephew, Feyd-Rautha
Harkonnen, will inherit Arrakis.

808
01:11:01,335 --> 01:11:02,774
He may be the answer.

809
01:11:02,909 --> 01:11:05,544
Feyd-Rautha? He's psychotic.

810
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:07,309
That's irrelevant.

811
01:11:07,444 --> 01:11:11,683
The question is,
can we control him?

812
01:11:11,819 --> 01:11:13,415
And I intend to find out.

813
01:11:20,256 --> 01:11:22,160
[suspenseful music playing]

814
01:11:30,537 --> 01:11:31,537
[sighs]

815
01:11:36,544 --> 01:11:39,276
[Feyd-Rautha] Would you like
some fresh meat, my darlings?

816
01:11:40,146 --> 01:11:42,977
- Lungs? Or liver?
- [grunts]

817
01:11:43,112 --> 01:11:46,282
[Feyd-Rautha] What would
you like? I hear they're big today.

818
01:11:46,418 --> 01:11:50,788
Your new blades for
this very special day,

819
01:11:50,923 --> 01:11:53,961
na-Baron, Feyd-Rautha.

820
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:11,374
[weapon master
breathing heavily]

821
01:12:12,608 --> 01:12:14,088
- [blade swishes] -
[attendant chokes]

822
01:12:14,209 --> 01:12:15,508
[bowl clanks]

823
01:12:15,644 --> 01:12:17,749
- [attendant chokes]
- [body thuds]

824
01:12:17,885 --> 01:12:21,320
- [blade stabs]
- [gasps]

825
01:12:21,456 --> 01:12:22,783
[thuds]

826
01:12:22,919 --> 01:12:24,108
- [Feyd-Rautha] A notch off balance.
- [harpies hiss]

827
01:12:24,188 --> 01:12:25,268
[Feyd-Rautha] It's the tip.

828
01:12:25,957 --> 01:12:27,286
Should be sharper.

829
01:12:27,422 --> 01:12:29,326
[man struggling, grunting]

830
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:36,135
[panting]

831
01:12:38,133 --> 01:12:39,468
[door opens]

832
01:12:41,809 --> 01:12:43,107
[slave master] Come.

833
01:12:43,242 --> 01:12:45,379
[Lanville] I won't
die like a fool.

834
01:12:45,514 --> 01:12:46,440
Kill me now.

835
01:12:46,576 --> 01:12:49,445
No drug for you today, Atreides.

836
01:12:51,547 --> 01:12:53,086
- [crowd cheering]
- [horn blowing]

837
01:12:53,222 --> 01:12:56,386
[gladiator arena announcer
speaks Harkonnen]

1852
01:12:54,227 --> 01:12:59,982
Under our glorious black sun,
we welcome to these special festivities

1853
01:13:01,359 --> 01:13:05,238
our beloved leader
Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.

838
01:13:03,028 --> 01:13:05,065
[dramatic music playing]

839
01:13:11,432 --> 01:13:13,941
[continuous banging]

840
01:13:14,076 --> 01:13:16,274
[gladiator arena
announcer continues]

1854
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:21,379
His presence today, watching over
a spectacle of blood and honor,

1855
01:13:22,046 --> 01:13:28,844
marks the Holy Birthday
of our beloved na-Baron, Feyd-Rautha.

841
01:13:23,244 --> 01:13:25,646
[crowd cheering]

842
01:13:29,825 --> 01:13:33,027
[all chanting in Harkonnen]

843
01:13:53,177 --> 01:13:54,675
[continuous banging]

844
01:14:04,592 --> 01:14:06,576
[Lady Margot Fenring]
Welcome to Giedi Prime, sisters.

845
01:14:06,656 --> 01:14:08,661
I hope your travels
were agreeable.

846
01:14:08,797 --> 01:14:11,149
[Bene Gesserit sister 1] A long way
to come just to watch our prospect

847
01:14:11,229 --> 01:14:13,063
risk his life, Lady Fenring.

848
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:15,131
[Lady Margot Fenring] No fear.

849
01:14:15,267 --> 01:14:17,170
These fights are all for show.

850
01:14:18,437 --> 01:14:20,735
But we'll get a
good look at him.

851
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:24,804
[gladiator arena announcer
speaking Harkonnen]

852
01:14:25,979 --> 01:14:28,214
[dramatic music playing]

853
01:14:33,854 --> 01:14:36,156
[horn blowing]

854
01:14:42,891 --> 01:14:47,200
[crowd chanting]
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

855
01:15:15,730 --> 01:15:17,627
[crowd cheering]

856
01:15:17,762 --> 01:15:20,860
[gladiator arena announcer
speaking Harkonnen]

1856
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:22,875
In celebration of our
na-Baron Feyd-Rautha,

1857
01:15:23,417 --> 01:15:25,711
we present a special treat.

1858
01:15:32,593 --> 01:15:36,639
The last three specimens
of House Atreides.

857
01:16:01,372 --> 01:16:02,539
That slave isn't drugged.

858
01:16:03,441 --> 01:16:05,377
That bug is walking straight.

859
01:16:06,443 --> 01:16:07,608
You should cancel the fight.

860
01:16:07,744 --> 01:16:10,442
Don't spoil my
nephew's birthday.

861
01:16:10,578 --> 01:16:13,049
[dramatic music playing]

862
01:16:13,184 --> 01:16:14,848
[breathes heavily]

863
01:16:17,318 --> 01:16:18,390
[grunts]

864
01:16:26,228 --> 01:16:27,998
[shouts]

865
01:16:28,134 --> 01:16:29,335
[Feyd-Rautha grunts]

866
01:16:31,873 --> 01:16:34,538
[both grunt, yell]

867
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:41,380
[both grunt, yell]

868
01:16:43,751 --> 01:16:45,080

869
01:16:45,215 --> 01:16:47,584

[panting]

872
01:16:58,165 --> 01:17:00,964
Happy birthday, dear nephew.

873
01:17:01,099 --> 01:17:03,098
[crowd cheering]

874
01:17:03,233 --> 01:17:05,965
[both grunting]

875
01:17:17,278 --> 01:17:19,402
[Bene Gesserit sister 2]
Why do they not stop the fight?

876
01:17:19,482 --> 01:17:21,251
Plans within plans.

877
01:17:21,386 --> 01:17:22,916
[suspenseful music playing]

878
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:27,756
Show me who you are.

879
01:17:34,297 --> 01:17:35,962
[crowd cheering]

880
01:17:44,538 --> 01:17:46,313
There he is.

881
01:17:47,013 --> 01:17:49,580
[horn blows]

882
01:18:00,721 --> 01:18:03,022

01:18:28,421 --> 01:18:30,757
[Lanville yells in pain, groans]

888
01:18:30,892 --> 01:18:32,689
Back! Back!

889
01:18:38,225 --> 01:18:40,994
- [Lanville grunts] -
[Feyd-Rautha laughs]

890
01:18:49,275 --> 01:18:50,205
[picadors chittering]

891
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:51,471
Stay back!

892
01:18:51,607 --> 01:18:54,106
[Lanville grunting]

893
01:19:05,153 --> 01:19:07,790
[whispers] You have
fought well, Atreides.

894
01:19:08,896 --> 01:19:09,957
Hmm.

895
01:19:10,092 --> 01:19:11,794
- [crowd cheering] -
[Feyd-Rautha grunts]

896
01:19:12,826 --> 01:19:14,896
[upbeat music playing]

01:19:19,167 --> 01:19:23,905
[crowd chanting]
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

898
01:19:29,348 --> 01:19:30,648
He's impressive, indeed.

899
01:19:30,783 --> 01:19:34,817
[crowd chanting]
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

900
01:19:42,597 --> 01:19:44,431
[Feyd-Rautha] The
slave wasn't drugged.

901
01:19:45,428 --> 01:19:46,461
[clicks tongue]

902
01:19:46,596 --> 01:19:48,928
You tried to kill me.

903
01:19:49,064 --> 01:19:51,531
This morning you were a playboy,

904
01:19:51,666 --> 01:19:53,468
feared and envied,

905
01:19:53,604 --> 01:19:57,008
but tonight you're a hero.

906
01:19:57,143 --> 01:19:58,575
My gift to you.

907
01:19:58,711 --> 01:20:00,606
I ought to drown
you in that tub.

908
01:20:00,742 --> 01:20:02,145
[Baron Harkonnen laughs]

909
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:04,381
Don't be hasty.

910
01:20:04,516 --> 01:20:07,051
I have another gift for you.

911
01:20:07,187 --> 01:20:08,554
A bigger one.

912
01:20:10,056 --> 01:20:11,519
Arrakis.

913
01:20:11,654 --> 01:20:13,724
[tense music playing]

914
01:20:15,393 --> 01:20:16,960
What about Rabban?

915
01:20:17,096 --> 01:20:19,461
[Baron Harkonnen] He has
failed to protect spice production.

916
01:20:19,597 --> 01:20:21,963
Rabban will be reassigned.

917
01:20:24,368 --> 01:20:25,598
[chuckles]

918
01:20:25,734 --> 01:20:28,539
Tame Arrakis, Feyd.

919
01:20:28,675 --> 01:20:31,478
Free the spice. I'll
make you Emperor.

920
01:20:43,587 --> 01:20:45,624
[clicks tongue] Emperor?

921
01:20:48,622 --> 01:20:49,793
How?

922
01:20:51,733 --> 01:20:54,864
The Emperor helped
me destroy the Atreides.

923
01:20:55,999 --> 01:20:58,872
He lent his own
army to the cause.

924
01:20:59,007 --> 01:21:01,040
A serious crime.

925
01:21:01,175 --> 01:21:05,776
If it came to light, the Great
Houses would rise against him.

926
01:21:06,410 --> 01:21:07,811
And then...

927
01:21:08,877 --> 01:21:11,518
who will sit on the throne?

928
01:21:12,286 --> 01:21:15,522
Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen.

929
01:21:53,127 --> 01:21:54,127
[blade swishes]

930
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:56,893
You're following me.

931
01:21:58,263 --> 01:21:59,291
Am I?

932
01:22:01,269 --> 01:22:02,800
I may have gotten lost.

933
01:22:04,567 --> 01:22:09,675
Will you show me the way out
of this maze, my Lord na-Baron?

934
01:22:16,713 --> 01:22:19,080
We've met, haven't we?

935
01:22:22,355 --> 01:22:23,656
I don't think so.

936
01:22:24,424 --> 01:22:26,724
I'm Lady Margot Fenring.

937
01:22:26,860 --> 01:22:29,055
I'm here to honor
your coming of age.

938
01:22:29,190 --> 01:22:31,158
You're not allowed
in this section.

939
01:22:32,094 --> 01:22:33,593
How did you get past the guards?

940
01:22:33,728 --> 01:22:35,129
The guards?

941
01:22:37,904 --> 01:22:40,002
[distorted] May I ask,

01:34:18,799 --> 01:34:20,636
you may still have an option.

1113
01:34:23,977 --> 01:34:25,003
Fire power...

1114
01:34:26,541 --> 01:34:28,413
which you don't have.

1115
01:34:30,379 --> 01:34:31,548
And here I am.

1116
01:34:35,820 --> 01:34:38,555
I know where your father
hid the family atomics.

1117
01:34:43,762 --> 01:34:46,761
[Paul] Every House
possesses an atomic arsenal.

1118
01:34:48,136 --> 01:34:50,061
I thought ours had been lost.

1119
01:34:52,133 --> 01:34:54,901
It's huge, Chani. It
could change everything.

1120
01:34:59,976 --> 01:35:03,547
I could aim the bombs
at the main spice fields.

1121
01:35:05,115 --> 01:35:08,717
He who can destroy a
thing has the real control of it.

1122
01:35:10,050 --> 01:35:11,885
So, you can
control it and not us?

1123
01:35:13,955 --> 01:35:15,955
You promised me
you didn't want power.

1124
01:35:17,664 --> 01:35:19,563
No matter what I do,
you still don't trust me.

1125
01:35:19,699 --> 01:35:22,665
'Cause you're a
foreigner. Like your friend.

1126
01:35:25,006 --> 01:35:26,603
I'm not a foreigner.

1127
01:35:34,211 --> 01:35:35,377
Not to me.

1128
01:35:35,512 --> 01:35:37,383
But to the desert, you are.

1129
01:35:38,283 --> 01:35:40,485
My allegiance is to you.

1130
01:35:41,153 --> 01:35:42,252
To the Fremen.

1131
01:35:42,388 --> 01:35:44,390
I'm doing this for all of us.

1132
01:35:45,652 --> 01:35:46,722
Do you believe me?

1133
01:35:55,267 --> 01:35:56,534
I'll talk to Stilgar.

1134
01:36:04,439 --> 01:36:05,642
[Gurney] There.

1135
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:13,078
It's right under
everybody's noses.

1136
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:15,513
Not clever.

1137
01:36:15,648 --> 01:36:17,116
That's the idea.

1138
01:36:17,252 --> 01:36:19,854
Nobody would ever look in
there because it's obvious.

1139
01:36:22,329 --> 01:36:24,192
- Not clever.
- [chuckles]

1140
01:36:24,327 --> 01:36:25,693

1141
01:36:25,829 --> 01:36:28,098
- I didn't look for it.
- [chuckles]

1142
01:36:28,234 --> 01:36:29,699
How many heads exactly?

1143
01:36:31,164 --> 01:36:33,505
Enough to blow
up the whole planet.

1144
01:36:36,374 --> 01:36:37,938
It's a figure of speech.

1145

Reports from the south

1159

02:03:05,291 --> 02:03:07,224
It is the only way.

1431
02:03:07,359 --> 02:03:09,192
I'm pointing the way!

1432
02:03:09,327 --> 02:03:11,569
[crowd murmuring]

1433
02:03:11,704 --> 02:03:12,933
[whispers] Slow down.

1434
02:03:13,068 --> 02:03:16,007
[shouting in Chakobsa]

1897
02:03:13,996 --> 02:03:20,711
There is no one in this room
who can stand against me!

1435
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:22,079
[crowd clamoring]

1898
02:03:32,765 --> 02:03:36,561
Your mothers warned you
about my coming!

1899
02:03:37,895 --> 02:03:40,022
Fear the moment.

1436
02:03:38,289 --> 02:03:40,196
[silence]

1437
02:03:48,602 --> 02:03:51,042
But you think you
could have a chance.

1438
02:03:53,108 --> 02:03:55,376
[speaking Chakobsa]

1900
02:03:54,495 --> 02:03:57,415
But you're afraid.

1901
02:03:57,832 --> 02:04:00,293
What if I could be the One?

1902
02:04:01,252 --> 02:04:05,506
This could be the moment you've been
praying for, all your life.

1903
02:04:08,175 --> 02:04:12,221
You're praying now,
to your grandmother.

1904
02:04:12,597 --> 02:04:16,434
She died nine moons ago.

1905
02:04:18,811 --> 02:04:20,479
She lost an eye.

1906
02:04:20,813 --> 02:04:24,609
A rock smashed her face
as she was crossing the Belt.

1907
02:04:25,443 --> 02:04:28,154
She was 12 when it happened.

1908
02:04:28,529 --> 02:04:33,284
At that time, this world
had a Fremen name.

1439
02:04:34,916 --> 02:04:36,245
Dune.

1440
02:04:36,381 --> 02:04:37,749
<i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

1441
02:04:37,884 --> 02:04:40,217
[crowd chanting] <i>Lisan
al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

1442
02:04:40,353 --> 02:04:41,690
[speaking Chakobsa]

1443
02:04:41,826 --> 02:04:43,259
<i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

1444
02:04:46,832 --> 02:04:48,330
[shouting in Chakobsa]

1909
02:04:48,341 --> 02:04:52,845
In your nightmares,
you give water to the dead,

1910
02:04:53,137 --> 02:04:54,931
and it brings joy to your heart!

1445
02:04:54,235 --> 02:04:55,235
[crying] <i>Muad'Dib!</i>

1446
02:04:55,337 --> 02:04:57,405

[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa]

1911
02:05:04,148 --> 02:05:06,692
Mahdi, what do you foresee for us?

1449
02:05:06,918 --> 02:05:08,377
[speaking Chakobsa]

1912
02:05:08,319 --> 02:05:10,696
Green Paradise.

1450
02:05:08,512 --> 02:05:10,748
[crowd exclaiming]

1913
02:05:12,031 --> 02:05:16,577
Lisan al-Gaib, show us the Way!

1451
02:05:21,563 --> 02:05:23,827
This is my father's
ducal signet.

1452
02:05:27,003 --> 02:05:28,304
[gasps softly]

1453
02:05:33,806 --> 02:05:36,712
[yelling] I am Paul
<i>Muad'Dib</i> Atreides,

1454
02:05:36,847 --> 02:05:38,677
Duke of Arrakis.

1455
02:05:39,852 --> 02:05:41,713
[speaking Chakobsa]

1914
02:05:40,726 --> 02:05:42,937
The Hand of God be my witness!

1915
02:05:43,437 --> 02:05:45,898
I am the Voice from the Outer World!

1916
02:05:46,190 --> 02:05:48,568
I will lead you to paradise!

1456
02:05:47,754 --> 02:05:49,392
- [crowd cheers]

[breathes deeply]

1465
02:06:47,045 --> 02:06:49,715
[Irulan] Paul
Atreides is still alive.

1466
02:06:51,286 --> 02:06:52,982
He challenges my father.

1467
02:06:54,259 --> 02:06:56,227
You've never been on Arrakis.

1468
02:06:57,494 --> 02:06:59,393
It's quite impressive.
You'll see.

1469
02:06:59,528 --> 02:07:01,026
Was this all upon your advice?

1470
02:07:01,161 --> 02:07:02,895
What?

1471
02:07:03,031 --> 02:07:05,963
Did you counsel my father
to exterminate the Atreides?

1472
02:07:06,098 --> 02:07:09,537
Of course I did. Why else
would it have happened?

1473
02:07:09,672 --> 02:07:12,008
You tried to sacrifice
an entire bloodline.

1474
02:07:12,144 --> 02:07:13,904
And I was right to do it.

1475
02:07:14,039 --> 02:07:17,278
The <i>Kwisatz Haderach</i>
is a form of power

1476
02:07:17,414 --> 02:07:19,541
that our world has not yet seen.

1477
02:07:19,677 --> 02:07:22,181
The ultimate power.

1478
02:07:22,317 --> 02:07:23,846
For ninety generations,

1479
02:07:23,981 --> 02:07:25,954
we have supervised
House Atreides.

1480
02:07:26,089 --> 02:07:29,225
They were promising, but they
were becoming dangerously defiant.

1481
02:07:29,361 --> 02:07:32,692
Their bloodline had
to be terminated.

1482
02:07:32,828 --> 02:07:35,194
That is why we have put
many bloodlines at work.

1483
02:07:35,329 --> 02:07:36,261
Several prospects.

1484
02:07:36,397 --> 02:07:37,932
But it's backfired.

1485
02:07:38,068 --> 02:07:39,468
Paul is alive.

1486
02:07:39,603 --> 02:07:41,283
And if he defeats
Feyd-Rautha, my father...

1487
02:07:41,367 --> 02:07:45,674
Your father will lose the
throne no matter who prevails.

1488
02:07:45,810 --> 02:07:48,712
But there is one way your
family can remain in power

1489
02:07:48,847 --> 02:07:52,481
and, through you, the
continuation of our stewardship.

1490
02:07:53,379 --> 02:07:55,418
One. Way.

1491
02:07:56,053 --> 02:07:58,049
Are you prepared?

1492
02:07:58,185 --> 02:08:01,292
You've been preparing me
my whole life, Reverend Mother.

1493
02:08:03,395 --> 02:08:05,795
You're heading
north with the others?

1494
02:08:05,931 --> 02:08:07,356
I'm Fedaykin.

1495
02:08:07,492 --> 02:08:10,298
I follow my leaders. If
fighting goes north, I go north.

1496
02:08:10,433 --> 02:08:11,713
Paul didn't have
a choice, Chani.

1497
02:08:11,829 --> 02:08:14,367
I won't be fighting for him.

1498
02:08:14,502 --> 02:08:15,999
I'm fighting for my people.

1499
02:08:19,675 --> 02:08:21,708
I came to wish you best of luck.

1500
02:08:22,773 --> 02:08:24,546
I'd wish you the same,

1501
02:08:26,319 --> 02:08:28,077
but it seems you've
won your battle.

1502
02:08:40,558 --> 02:08:42,762
[whooshing]

1503
02:08:51,209 --> 02:08:52,706
[Gurney] He took the bait.

1504
02:08:59,044 --> 02:09:01,385
[Paul] Oh, the
Emperor's very obliging.

1505
02:09:02,219 --> 02:09:03,981
He's right on time.

1506
02:09:04,749 --> 02:09:06,984
[speaking Chakobsa]

1917
02:09:05,848 --> 02:09:07,642
As you foresaw, Muad'Dib...

1918
02:09:10,019 --> 02:09:11,812
a great-grandmother of a storm.

1507
02:09:25,372 --> 02:09:27,675
[whooshing]

1508
02:09:37,089 --> 02:09:38,950
What is he doing here?

1509
02:09:39,085 --> 02:09:41,590
I brought spice
production under control.

1510
02:09:44,557 --> 02:09:45,924
What do we do?

1511
02:09:47,092 --> 02:09:49,896
Send messages to
the Great Houses.

1512
02:09:50,031 --> 02:09:53,965
Tell them that Arrakis is
under Sardaukar attack.

1513
02:09:54,100 --> 02:09:57,166
Tell them, their future
hangs in the balance.

1514
02:10:21,100 --> 02:10:23,027
[whispering in Chakobsa]

1919
02:10:22,341 --> 02:10:24,552
He brought his whole army.

1515
02:10:24,130 --> 02:10:26,734
[Paul] When the
storm hits this ridge,

1516
02:10:26,869 --> 02:10:29,032
Gurney will open the
way for you, Stilgar,

1517
02:10:29,167 --> 02:10:31,539
so you can enter the
basin from the West

1518
02:10:31,675 --> 02:10:33,905
and distract their
defense systems.

1519
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:35,740
Chani, I want you
and your Fedaykin

1520
02:10:35,876 --> 02:10:37,580
to then attack from the East,

1521
02:10:38,347 --> 02:10:40,077
inside the basin.

1522
02:10:40,212 --> 02:10:42,417
I'll strike from the
North, head on,

1523
02:10:42,552 --> 02:10:44,519
with the Fundamentalist troops.

1524
02:10:44,655 --> 02:10:47,391
And I'll serve
Arrakeen for dessert.

1525
02:10:47,526 --> 02:10:49,889
Remember, I need
the Emperor alive.

1526
02:10:50,657 --> 02:10:52,995
[speaking Chakobsa]

1920
02:10:52,079 --> 02:10:54,624
Long live the fighters.

1527
02:10:53,130 --> 02:10:55,796
[all repeat]

1528
02:10:57,433 --> 02:10:59,965
[indistinct chatter]

Hm.

1533
02:11:53,720 --> 02:11:56,186
[breathing heavily]

1534
02:11:59,295 --> 02:12:01,292
[Emperor] Baron,

1535
02:12:01,428 --> 02:12:06,164
do you have any idea who
this <i>Muad'Dib</i> could be?

1536
02:12:06,299 --> 02:12:09,370
Some fanatic, your
Majesty. That's all we know.

1537
02:12:09,506 --> 02:12:11,403
More. More. Give me more.

1538
02:12:11,539 --> 02:12:12,573
He's a madman!

1539
02:12:12,708 --> 02:12:14,875
- Mad?
- All Fremen are mad.

1540
02:12:17,043 --> 02:12:19,178
[scoffing] That's all you know?

1541
02:12:19,314 --> 02:12:20,979
Really?

1542
02:12:21,115 --> 02:12:23,048
[Feyd-Rautha] <i>Muad'Dib</i> is dead.

1543
02:12:25,152 --> 02:12:28,258
Or he went hiding in
the Southern storms

1544
02:12:28,393 --> 02:12:29,960
which means the same thing.

1545
02:12:30,095 --> 02:12:30,721
[signing]

1921
02:12:30,553 --> 02:12:33,014
They speak the truth.

1546
02:12:30,856 --> 02:12:32,055
[Bashar] Your Majesty,

1547
02:12:32,191 --> 02:12:33,628
the sand storm
that's approaching

1548
02:12:33,764 --> 02:12:36,059
threatens the
integrity of our shields.

1549
02:12:36,195 --> 02:12:38,098
We recommend
going back into orbit.

1550
02:12:38,234 --> 02:12:40,604
Well, the mountains will
protect us from most of it,

1551
02:12:41,437 --> 02:12:42,837
your Majesty.

1552
02:12:44,235 --> 02:12:48,478
Baron, have you
ever investigated

1553
02:12:48,613 --> 02:12:51,845
the south regions of Arrakis?

1554
02:12:51,981 --> 02:12:54,582
Well, the entire
region is uninhabitable.

1555
02:12:54,717 --> 02:12:57,113
It's well known, your Majesty.

1556
02:12:57,249 --> 02:13:01,458
[Emperor] Your uninhabited South

1557
02:13:01,594 --> 02:13:04,559
exhibits evidence
of human activity.

1558
02:13:04,694 --> 02:13:06,894
[Baron] I wasn't aware of this.

1559
02:13:07,029 --> 02:13:09,461
I swear to you, I wasn't
aware of any of this.

1560
02:13:09,596 --> 02:13:10,926
[Baron gasping]

1561
02:13:11,062 --> 02:13:13,131
- [groans]
- [gasps]

1562
02:13:14,573 --> 02:13:16,200
[Emperor] <i>Muad'Dib</i> is alive.

1563
02:13:17,472 --> 02:13:18,873
I must find him.

1564
02:13:23,777 --> 02:13:27,178

[Paul] How can you be so sure
the Great Houses are here for me?

1642
02:26:07,474 --> 02:26:11,880
They may be curious to hear my
side of the story, don't you think?

1643
02:26:12,016 --> 02:26:16,782
I am Paul Atreides, son of

- Gurney.
- My Lord.

Send a warning to all ships.

- You're out of your mind.
- He's bluffing.

As a servant of the Imperium,
you will bow at my feet.

Your feet? You'll be
lucky to keep your head.

1655
02:26:56,758 --> 02:26:58,593
I'll take the hand
of your daughter.

1656
02:27:00,890 --> 02:27:02,795
She will remain safe.

1657
02:27:02,930 --> 02:27:05,468

[Paul] But you...

1660
02:27:19,451 --> 02:27:21,209
You have to
answer for my father.

1661
02:27:28,656 --> 02:27:32,594
Do you know why I killed him?

1662
02:27:33,659 --> 02:27:35,530
Because he was a man

1663
02:27:35,666 --> 02:27:37,830
who believed in the
rules of the heart.

1664
02:27:38,998 --> 02:27:41,097
But the heart is
not meant to rule.

1665
02:27:42,502 --> 02:27:43,737
In other words...

1666
02:27:45,936 --> 02:27:49,809
your father was a weak man.

1667
02:27:58,686 --> 02:28:01,920
Stand or choose your champion.

1668
02:28:04,562 --> 02:28:06,188
[Feyd-Rautha] I
am here, Atreides.

1669
02:28:08,560 --> 02:28:09,899
I need a blade.

1670
02:28:10,034 --> 02:28:11,666
Accept mine.

1671
02:28:23,273 --> 02:28:26,379
Do not stain your
hands on this animal.

1672
02:28:26,514 --> 02:28:27,742
Let me deal with him.

1673
02:28:27,878 --> 02:28:29,816
It's my burden, Gurney.

[Feyd-Rautha exhales]

1675
02:28:48,339 --> 02:28:50,535
Why does he take such risks?

Cousin? Is that right?

1680
02:29:26,471 --> 02:29:31,779
Well, you wouldn't be
the first relative I've killed.

1681
02:29:34,177 --> 02:29:37,213
May thy knife chip and shatter.

1682
02:29:40,253 --> 02:29:44,792

thy knife chip and shatter.
